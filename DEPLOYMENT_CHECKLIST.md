# ðŸš€ API DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## Pre-Deployment Security Verification
- [ ] All admin endpoints require authentication
- [ ] SQL injection vulnerabilities fixed
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented on critical endpoints
- [ ] Input validation added to all user inputs
- [ ] Security headers applied to all routes
- [ ] Error responses standardized (no information leakage)
- [ ] JWT validation properly implemented
- [ ] Request size limits configured

## Performance Optimization Verification
- [ ] Intelligent caching implemented
- [ ] N+1 query issues resolved
- [ ] Database connection pooling optimized
- [ ] Response compression enabled
- [ ] Async operations used throughout
- [ ] API response times < 1 second

## Scientific Research Data Integrity
- [ ] All data sources verified as government APIs
- [ ] No mock or fake data in production
- [ ] Data source validation implemented
- [ ] Research compliance maintained

## Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Run security validation: `python scripts/psychopath_api_audit.py`
2. [ ] Run health validation: `python scripts/api_health_validator.py`
3. [ ] Run data integrity check: `python scripts/enforce_data_integrity.py`
4. [ ] Deploy to staging environment
5. [ ] Run full integration tests
6. [ ] Load test with real data
7. [ ] Security scan production deployment
8. [ ] Deploy to production
9. [ ] Verify all endpoints working
10. [ ] Monitor for 24 hours

## Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] API response times monitoring
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Security alert monitoring
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Real data source health monitoring

## Emergency Rollback Plan
- [ ] Previous version tagged and ready
- [ ] Database migration rollback tested
- [ ] Cache clear procedure documented
- [ ] Incident response team on standby
