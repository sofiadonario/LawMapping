# AWS Account Registration & Password Issues - Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Common AWS Account Registration Problems

If you're having trouble registering or setting a password for your AWS account, here are the most common issues and solutions:

## Issue 1: Password Requirements Not Met

AWS has strict password requirements for root accounts:

### Password Requirements:
- **Minimum 8 characters**
- **Maximum 128 characters**
- Must contain **at least 3** of the following:
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':\",./<>?)

### ‚ùå Common Password Mistakes:
- Using simple passwords like "password123"
- Not including special characters
- Using only letters or only numbers
- Using spaces (not allowed)

### ‚úÖ Example Strong Password:
`MySecure2024!Pass`

## Issue 2: Account Already Exists

### Error: "Email address already in use"

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Password Recovery**
1. Go to AWS Sign-in page
2. Click "Forgot password?"
3. Enter your email address
4. Check email for reset instructions
5. Follow the link to create new password

**Option B: Email Subaddressing**
If you can't recover the existing account:
1. Use email subaddressing: `youremail+aws@domain.com`
2. This creates a "new" email that goes to same inbox
3. Test first: send an email to verify it works

## Issue 3: Email Verification Problems

### Not Receiving Verification Email?

**Check These:**
1. **Spam/Junk folder** - AWS emails often end up here
2. **Email filters** - Check if blocking emails from AWS
3. **Correct email address** - Verify spelling
4. **Wait time** - Can take up to 15 minutes

**Email sources to whitelist:**
- `@signin.aws`
- `@verify.signin.aws`
- `@amazon.com`
- `@aws.amazon.com`

## Issue 4: Phone Verification Problems

### Common Phone Issues:
- **Wrong country code**
- **Invalid phone format**
- **VoIP numbers not accepted**
- **Maximum attempts exceeded**

**Solutions:**
1. Use mobile number (not landline if possible)
2. Include correct country code (+1 for US)
3. Format: +1-555-123-4567
4. Wait 24 hours if you hit max attempts

## Issue 5: Credit Card Verification

### Card Requirements:
- Must be valid credit/debit card
- Must match billing address exactly
- International cards accepted
- Prepaid cards usually NOT accepted

## Issue 6: Account Activation Delays

### "Account in invalid state" error

**Normal timeline:**
- Account creation: Immediate
- **Full activation: Up to 24 hours**
- Sometimes requires additional verification

**If it's been over 24 hours:**
1. Check email for additional verification requests
2. Contact AWS Support via billing support form

## Step-by-Step Registration Process

### 1. Go to AWS Registration
Visit: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup

### 2. Choose Account Type
- **Personal** - Individual use
- **Professional** - Business use

### 3. Enter Account Information
```
Email address: [use a valid email you control]
Password: [follow requirements above]
Confirm password: [exactly the same]
AWS Account name: [descriptive name]
```

### 4. Contact Information
- Full name or company name
- Address (must match credit card)
- Phone number with country code

### 5. Payment Information
- Credit/debit card details
- Billing address (exactly as on card statement)

### 6. Identity Verification
- Phone verification with PIN
- Follow prompts carefully

### 7. Support Plan
- Choose "Basic" (free) for now
- Can upgrade later if needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Commands

Once you have account access, verify with:

```powershell
# Test basic AWS access
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Check account status
aws iam get-account-summary
```

## üÜò When to Contact AWS Support

Contact AWS Support if:
- Account activation takes over 24 hours
- Repeated verification failures
- Credit card accepted but account still blocked
- Receiving "account in invalid state" errors

**Contact method:**
Use the "Account and Billing Support" form:
https://support.aws.amazon.com/#/contacts/aws-account-support

## üîê Security Tips

### After Account Creation:
1. **Enable MFA immediately**
2. **Create IAM user** (don't use root for daily work)
3. **Set up billing alerts**
4. **Review security settings**

### Password Best Practices:
- Use a password manager
- Enable 2FA/MFA
- Never share credentials
- Change password if compromised

## Alternative: AWS Free Tier Account

If still having issues, try:
1. Different email address
2. Different browser/incognito mode
3. Different network connection
4. Mobile device vs desktop
